# SentimentSpectra

SentimentSpectra is a simple yet powerful tool to detect and visualize the emotional tone of any given text. Using machine learning techniques, SentimentSpectra can analyze text and predict the underlying sentiment.

## Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on the emotion dataset to classify text into different emotional categories. The user enters the text in a form, the model makes the prediction, and presents the results on a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
The application requires the following libraries:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Altair
- Joblib

### Installation

Follow the steps below to run the application:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned project
3. Install the necessary packages
4. Run the Streamlit app


## Features

- User-friendly interface to input text.
- Uses machine learning to analyze the emotional tone of the input text.
- Displays the predicted emotion with the corresponding emoji.
- Provides a bar chart visualization for prediction probabilities of each emotion.
