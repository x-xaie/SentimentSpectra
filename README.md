# VisualVortex

VisualVortex is an image classification app that leverages the power of the MobileNet V2 model to accurately classify and categorize images. With VisualVortex, users can easily upload and analyze images, gaining insights and information about the visual content.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes the MobileNet V2 deep learning model, which has been trained on a large dataset of images, to classify and recognize objects within images. The user can upload an image through the app, and VisualVortex will process the image using the trained model to identify the objects present. The results are then displayed to the user, providing a valuable tool for image analysis and understanding.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
To run VisualVortex, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
