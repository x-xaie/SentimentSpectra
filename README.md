# SentimentSpectra

SentimentSpectra is a simple yet powerful tool to detect and visualize the emotional tone of any given text. Using machine learning techniques, SentimentSpectra can analyze text and predict the underlying sentiment.

## Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on the emotion dataset to classify text into different emotional categories. The user enters the text in a form, the model makes the prediction, and presents the results on a user-friendly interface powered by Streamlit.

## Installation & Usage
